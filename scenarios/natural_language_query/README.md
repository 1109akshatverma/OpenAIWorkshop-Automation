# Build Open AI Application on Power App to allow users to use natural language question on top of SQL data
### Summary.

This scenario allows use cases to use Open AI as an intelligent agent to get business promprs in natural language from end users and generating SQL queries from the prompts as:

Generating SQL queries from the natural language 
Giving direct answer to questions about specific product, service and process by excuting the query from SQL database.
Regardless of the application scenario, the solution flow is:
