    "location_description_context = '\\nUse the following tips, advice, and facts about each location (if provided) above to generate the description:\\n\\nField Museum: 1. The Field Museum can take more than a day to explore due to its size and scope; plan accordingly. 2. It might not be suitable for small children, as there are limited interactive exhibits and lots of reading. 3. The special exhibits may require an additional fee but can be worth it depending on your interests. 4. Some areas, like the Egyptian exhibit, have low lighting, making it challenging to read information. 5. Food inside the museum can be expensive; consider bringing your own food, as it is allowed. 6. The Field Museum is famous for its T. Rex skeleton called Sue and the large dinosaur exhibit, which is a must-see. 7. Visit the jade and gems exhibits on the upper floor, which are usually less crowded in the morning. 8. Using public transportation to get to the museum is highly recommended instead of driving and dealing with parking. 9. Handicap accessible East Entrance (on the path towards Shedd Aquarium) can have shorter lines. 10. When planning a visit, check the Field Museum\\'s website to see if it coincides with a free admission day, which can result in large crowds and longer wait times. 11. Use a City Pass for potential access to special ticketed exhibits and a 3D movie, though these extras are not considered essential for a great visit. 12. The 3D movie about Sue the T. Rex is highly rated, but the theater can be crowded. 13. The museum cafe\\'s food quality and options might not meet everyone\\'s preferences; consider bringing your own meal or snacks. 14. Purchase tickets ahead of time, as they sell out fast during peak times or due to the pandemic-entry restrictions. 15. The museum features exhibits on natural history, evolution, animal species, plants, gems, and human history. 16. Each visit to the museum can provide new learning experiences and discoveries, making it worthwhile to visit multiple times.\\nGrant Park: 1.
