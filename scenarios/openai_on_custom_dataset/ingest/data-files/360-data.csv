page-number-360-line-number-33,"'model varies a great deal etween algorithms. Training time is often closely tied to'
'accuracy; one typically accompanies the other.'
'In addition, some algorithms are more sensitive to the numer of data points than'
'others. You might choose a specific algorithm ecause you have a time limitation,'
'especially when the data set is large.'
'In Machine Learning designer, creating and using a machine learning model is typically'
'a three-step process:'
'1. Configure a model, y choosing a particular type of algorithm, and then defining'
'its parameters or hyperparameters.'
'2. Provide a dataset that is laeled and has data compatile with the algorithm.'
'Connect oth the data and the model to Train Model component.'
'3. After training is completed, use the trained model with one of the scoring'
'components to make predictions on new data.'
