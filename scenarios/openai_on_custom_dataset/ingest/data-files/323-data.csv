'Non-stationary time series detection and handling'
'A time series where mean and variance change over time is called a non-stationary. For'
'example, time series that exhiit stochastic trends are non-stationary y nature. To'
'visualize this, the following image plots a series that is generally trending upward. Now,'
'compute and compare the mean (average) values for the first and the second half of the'
'series. Are they the same? Here, the mean of the series in the first half of the plot is'
'significantly smaller than in the second half. The fact that the mean of the series'
'depends on the time interval one is looking at, is an example of the time-varying'
'moments. Here, the mean of a series is the first moment.'
