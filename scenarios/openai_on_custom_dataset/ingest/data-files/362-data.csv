'Parameters are the knos a data scientist gets to turn when setting up an algorithm.'
""They are numers that affect the algorithm's ehavior, such as error tolerance or""
'numer of iterations, or options etween variants of how the algorithm ehaves. The'
'training time and accuracy of the algorithm can sometimes e sensitive to getting just'
'the right settings. Typically, algorithms with large numers of parameters require the'
'most trial and error to find a good comination.'
'Alternatively, there is the Tune Model Hyperparameters component in Machine Learning'
'designer: The goal of this component is to determine the optimum hyperparameters for'
'a machine learning model. The component uilds and tests multiple models y using'
'different cominations of settings. It compares metrics over all models to get the'
'cominations of settings.'
""While this is a great way to make sure you've spanned the parameter space, the time""
'required to train a model increases exponentially with the numer of parameters. The'
'upside is that having many parameters typically indicates that an algorithm has greater'
'flexiility. It can often achieve very good accuracy, provided you can find the right'
'comination of parameter settings.'
