'You can use GitHu and Azure Pipelines to create a continuous integration process that'
'trains a model. In a typical scenario, when a data scientist checks a change into the Git'
'repo for a project, Azure Pipelines starts a training jo. The results of the jo can then e'
'inspected to see the performance characteristics of the trained model. You can also'
'create a pipeline that deploys the model as a we service.'
'The Machine Learning extension 2 makes it easier to work with Azure Pipelines. It'
'provides the following enhancements to Azure Pipelines:'
'Enales workspace selection when you define a service connection.'

'Enales release pipelines to e triggered y trained models created in a training'
