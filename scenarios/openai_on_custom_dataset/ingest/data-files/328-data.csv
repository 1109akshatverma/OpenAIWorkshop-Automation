'2. Sweep over regression models and rank them, along with the est time series'
'models from phase 1, according to their primary metric values from validation sets.'
'3. Build an ensemle model from the top ranked models, calculate its validation'
'metric, and rank it with the other models.'
'The model with the top ranked metric value at the end of phase 3 is designated the est'

""AutoML's final phase of model selection always calculates metrics on out-of-""
'sample data. That is, data that was not used to fit the models. This helps to protect'
'against over-fitting.'
'AutoML has two validation configurations - cross-validation and explicit validation data.'
'In the cross-validation case, AutoML uses the input configuration to create data splits'
'into training and validation folds. Time order must e preserved in these splits, so'
'AutoML uses so-called Rolling Origin Cross Validation which divides the series into'
'training and validation data using an origin time point. Sliding the origin in time'
