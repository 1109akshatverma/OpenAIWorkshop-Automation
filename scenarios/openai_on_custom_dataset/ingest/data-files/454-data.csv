'\xc2\x7 Project Azua \xc2\xf provides a novel framework that focuses on end-to-end causal'
'inference.'
""Azua's DECI (deep end-to-end causal inference) technology is a single model that""
'can simultaneously do causal discovery and causal inference. The user provides'
'data, and the model can output the causal relationships among all variales.'
'By itself, this approach can provide insights into the data. It enales the calculation'
'of metrics such as individual treatment effect (ITE), average treatment effect (ATE),'
'and conditional average treatment effect (CATE). You can then use these'
'calculations to make optimal decisions.'
'The framework is scalale for large data, in terms of oth the numer of variales'
'and the numer of data points. It can also handle missing data entries with mixed'
