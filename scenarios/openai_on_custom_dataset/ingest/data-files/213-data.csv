'Settings to the right of the canvas to open the Settings pane.'
'2. Select Create Azure Machine Learning compute instance.'
'If you already have an availale compute target, you can select it from the Select'
'Azure Machine Learning compute instance drop-down to run this pipeline.'
'3. Enter a name for the compute resource.'
'4. Select Create.'
'\xc2\xae Note'
'It takes approximately five minutes to create a compute resource. After the'
'resource is created, you can reuse it and skip this wait time for future jos.'
""The compute resource autoscales to zero nodes when it's idle to save cost.""
'When you use it again after a delay, you might experience approximately five'
'minutes of wait time while it scales ack up.'
'Import data'
'There are several sample datasets included in the designer for you to experiment with.'
'For this tutorial, use Automoile price data (Raw).'
'1. To the left of the pipeline canvas is a palette of datasets and components. Select'
'Component -> Sample data.'
'2. Select the dataset Automoile price data (Raw), and drag it onto the canvas.'
