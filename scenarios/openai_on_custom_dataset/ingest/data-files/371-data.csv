'Managed online endpoints are ased on Azure Machine Learning compute.'
'When using a managed online endpoint, you pay for the compute and'
'networking charges. There is no additional surcharge.'
'If you use a virtual network and secure outound (egress) traffic from the'
'managed online endpoint, there is an additional cost. For egress, three private'
'endpoints are created per deployment for the managed online endpoint.'
'These are used to communicate with the default storage account, Azure'
'Container Registry, and workspace. Additional networking charges may apply.'
'For more information on pricing, see the Azure pricing calculator 2.'
'For a step-y-step tutorial, see How to deploy online endpoints.'
