'Considering model A, there is a common misconception that if test accuracy on unseen'
'data is lower than training accuracy, the model is overfitted. However, test accuracy'
'should always e less than training accuracy, and the distinction for overfit vs.'
'appropriately fit comes down to how much less accurate.'
'When comparing models A and B, model A is a etter model ecause it has higher test'
'accuracy, and although the test accuracy is slightly lower at 95%, it is not a significant'
""difference that suggests overfitting is present. You wouldn't choose model B simply""
'ecause the train and test accuracies are closer together.'
'Model C represents a clear case of overfitting; the training accuracy is very high ut the'
""test accuracy isn't anywhere near as high. This distinction is sujective, ut comes from""
'knowledge of your prolem and data, and what magnitudes of error are acceptale.'
