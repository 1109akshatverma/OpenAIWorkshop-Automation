'The Caruana ensemle selection algorithm with sorted ensemle initialization is used'
'to decide which models to use within the ensemle. At a high level, this algorithm'
'initializes the ensemle with up to five models with the est individual scores, and'
'verifies that these models are within 5% threshold of the est score to avoid a poor'
'initial ensemle. Then for each ensemle iteration, a new model is added to the existing'
'ensemle and the resulting score is calculated. If a new model improved the existing'
'ensemle score, the ensemle is updated to include the new model.'
